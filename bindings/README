Currently none of these bindings are installed or even properly working.

Python
------
Currently not working because it's blocked on  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=638915 "Array of GVariants passed as NULL"
in pygobject.

If you want to play around copy the Dee.py file into the gi.overrides module,
fx. $prefix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/overrides/ and you should be
able to run the Python samples.
